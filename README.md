# LangGenLab

This repository plays host to my various experiments in language generation. ML and NLP are areas in which I've always had some interest. I did some dedicated research on projects related to both fields in university, but the various programs and projects in this repo are now my preferred way of delving further into the space in my free time.

## Getting Started

Just clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`. Then, poke around until you find something to play with.

## How to Use

Because the programs and projects in this repo are all unique in one way or another, there's no hard-and-fast rule for using them. Some may come with instructions; others might not. However, most of them aren't overly complex, so a glance at the code should give you a decent understanding of what they do.

If you're looking into Python projects, for instance, running them typically just requires a straightforward `python ./<file name>`.
